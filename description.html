	    In this demo, 25 balls(with random color and size) are created at random positions on the screen, and each one moves in 
		a random velocity. When a ball reaches the boundary, it bounces back, and when a ball comes across another ball, the color
        of both will change randomly.
        At the top are located four buttons. You can use the "accelerate" button to make the balls move faster
